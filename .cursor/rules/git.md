# Git Rules

## Branch Management

- Always lint code before committing
- Always use branches for changes (never commit directly to main)
- Always add meaningful comments to code
- Always create Pull Requests with detailed notes describing changes
- Default branch should be `Main`

## Branch Naming

- Unless there is a ticket number, branches should be named in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-description`
  - Example: `2024-11-21-update-storage-config`
  - Example: `2024-11-21-add-security-hardening`
- If a ticket number exists, use: `ticket-XXXX-description`
  - Example: `ticket-1234-fix-authentication`

## Pull Request Guidelines

- PR title should be descriptive and concise
- PR description should include:
  - What changed
  - Why it changed
  - How to test (if applicable)
  - Any breaking changes
- Link to related tickets/issues if applicable
- Request review from appropriate team members

## Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format when possible:
  - `feat: add new feature`
  - `fix: resolve bug`
  - `docs: update documentation`
  - `refactor: restructure code`
  - `test: add or update tests`
